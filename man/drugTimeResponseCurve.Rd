\usage{
drugTimeResponseCurve(tSets, duration, cellline, dose, drug,
  plot.type = "Actual", summarize.replicates = TRUE,
  viability_as_pct = TRUE, xlim = c(0, 24), ylim = c(0, 100), mycol,

}
\arguments{
\item{tSets}{[ToxicoSet] A ToxicoSet or list of ToxicoSets to be plotted in
this graph.}

\item{duration}{[character] A vector of durations to include in the plot.}

\item{dose}{[character] A vector of dose levels to be included in the
plot. Default to include all dose levels available for a drug. Must include
at minimum two dose levels, one of witch is "Control".}

\item{drug}{[character] A vector of drugs to be included in this plot.}

\item{plot.type}{[character] The type of plot which you would like returned. Options
 are 'Actual' for unfitted curve, 'Fitted' for the fitted curve and 'Both'
 to display 'Actual and 'Fitted' in the sample plot.
@param summarize.replciates [logical] If true will take the average of all
  replicates at each time point per dose and duration}

\item{viability_as_pct}{[logical] A vector specifying if viabilities should
be plotted as a percentage. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{xlim}{[numeric] A vector of minimum and maximum values for the x-axis
of the returned plot.}

\item{ylim}{[numeric] A vector of minimum and miximum values for the y-axis
of the returned plot.}

\item{mycol}{[vector] A vector of length equal to the lenth of the tSets
argument specifying which RColorBrewer colour to use per tSet. Default
colours will be used if this parameter is excluded.}

\item{x.custom.ticks}{[vector] A numeric vector of the distance between major
and minor ticks on the x-axis. If excluded ticks appear only where duration
values are specified.}

\item{title}{[character] A string containing the desired plot name. If excluded
a title wil be generated automatically.}

\item{lwd}{[numeric] The line width to plot width}

\item{cex}{[numeric] The cex parameter passed to plot}

\item{cex.main}{[numeric] The cex.main parameter passed to plot, controls the size of the titles}

\item{legend.loc}{[character] The location of the legend as passed to the plot()
function from base graphics.}

\item{verbose}{[boolean] Should warning messages about the data passed in be printed?}

\item{cellLine}{[character] A vector of cell lines to include in the plot.}

\item{legend.loc}{And argument passable to xy.coords for the position to place the legend.}

\item{trunc}{[bool] Should the viability values be truncated to lie in [0-100] before doing the fitting}
