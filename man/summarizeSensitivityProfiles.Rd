\title{Takes the sensitivity data from a ToxicoSet, and summarises them into a
drug vs cell line table}
\usage{
summarizeSensitivityProfiles(tSet,
  sensitivity.measure = "auc_recomputed", cell.lines, drugs, duration,
  summary.stat = c("mean", "median", "first", "last", "max", "min"),
  fill.missing = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tSet}{[ToxicoSet] The ToxicoSet from which to extract the data}

\item{sensitivity.measure}{[character] which sensitivity sensitivity.measure to use? Use the
sensitivityMeasures function to find out what measures are available for each TSet.}

\item{cell.lines}{\code{character} The cell lines to be summarized.
 If any cell lines has no data, it will be filled with
missing values}

\item{drugs}{\code{character} The drugs to be summarized.
If any drugs has no data, it will be filled with
missing values}

\item{duration}{\code{numeric} The duration at which to summarize
the drug-cell combo.}

\item{summary.stat}{\code{character} which summary method to use if there are repeated
cell line-drug experiments? Choices are "mean", "median", "first", "last", "max", or "min"}

\item{fill.missing}{\code{boolean} should the missing cell lines not in the
molecular data object be filled in with missing values?}

\item{verbose}{Should the function print progress messages?}
}
\value{
[matrix] A matrix with drugs going down the rows, cell lines across
  the columns, with the selected sensitivity statistic for each pair.
}
\description{
This function creates a table with drug as rows and cell lines as columns,
summarising the drug senstitivity data of a ToxicoSet into drug-cell line
pairs for a specified experiment duration.

\examples{
data(TGGATES_small)
TGGATESauc <- summarizeSensitivityProfiles(TGGATES_small, sensitivity.measure='auc_recomputed')
